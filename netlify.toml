# This is the final, robust, and correct configuration for a Python function on Netlify.
# It relies on Netlify's standard build process, which is the most reliable method.

# Base build settings
[build]
  # The folder with your site's static files (like index.html).
  # This tells Netlify where to find your main site.
  publish = "/"
  # The folder where your serverless functions live.
  # This tells the build system where to find the Python files.
  functions = "netlify/functions"

# Settings for the build environment itself
[build.environment]
  # Explicitly set the Python version to ensure compatibility.
  # Using a widely supported version like 3.8 is a safe and stable choice.
